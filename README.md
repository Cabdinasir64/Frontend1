# Frontend1

Frontend1 is a **Next.js** application designed to work seamlessly with a backend API. It enables real-time data interaction directly from the frontend, removing the need for Postman or other API testing tools.

## Features

- Built with **Next.js** for modern React-based frontend development.
- Connects directly to a backend API for live data operations.
- Supports real-time updates (via `fetch` or `Socket.io`) without manual API testing.
- Easy folder structure with separate `frontend` and `backend` directories.
